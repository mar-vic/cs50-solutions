# CS50 Solutions

## About CS50x

CS50x is online version of Harvard's introductory course on computer science
([course website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/)). The repository contains my
solutions to the course assignments. Some parts of the programs are boilerplates
provided by the course.

    Program requests a number from user and determines whether it is a valid
    ceridt card number.

## Week 2: Arrays
### Problem Set 2

+ [Readability](problem_sets/problem_set_2/readability/readability.c)

    Reimplements
    [readability.c](problem_sets/problem_set_2/readability/readability.c) in
    Python 

+ [DNA](problem_sets/problem_set_6/dna/dna.py)

    Implements a program that identifies a person based on their DNA

## Week 7: SQL
### Problem Set 7

+ [Movies](problem_sets/problem_set_7/movies/)

    Set of SQL queries to answer questions about IMDB database
    
#### Houses
